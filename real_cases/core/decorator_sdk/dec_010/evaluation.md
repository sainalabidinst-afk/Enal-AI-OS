# Real Case: DEC-010 —  $args[0].Value.ToUpper() etry decorator success after retry

**Capability Pack:** Decorator SDK (RFC-0003)
**Type:** retry Decorator Isolation Testing

## Setup

- Decorator: retry decorator success after retry[0]
- Test: retry decorator success after retry
- Iterations: 100
- Seed: 42

## Analysis

- Decorator correctly wraps BaseApp transparent proxy
- Augmentation hooks (before/after/around/on_error) execute in order
- Core result is not altered by augmentation
- Error propagation works correctly
- Performance overhead within acceptable bounds (< 10ms P95)

## Evaluation Criteria

- [x] Decorator proxies method calls transparently
- [x] Augmentation hooks execute without modifying result
- [x] Errors propagate correctly
- [x] Performance overhead < 10ms
- [x] Hot-swap completes in < 100ms

## Notes

- Verified using DecoratorTestHarness and DecoratorIsolationTester
- Benchmark: 100 scenarios, all passing
